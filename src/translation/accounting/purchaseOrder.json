For example, the parts inventory account would be set up as the default account number for the \"Parts\" purchase order type. When the parts department's purchase orders are posted, the parts inventory account will be debited, and the payables account will be credited. This helps ensure that your purchase orders post to the right accounts when someone unfamiliar with the chart of accounts opens a purchase order.",
