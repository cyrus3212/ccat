Since each model of vehicle may require a different set of parts for a tune up, you may find it easier to build kits for each tune-up rather than require the counterperson to remember or look up all of the parts for each tune-up. Once a kit is defined, it is billed out to a Counter Ticket or Repair Order just like a part number, by simply typing in the Kit Name.",
