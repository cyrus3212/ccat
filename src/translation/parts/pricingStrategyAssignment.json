Price Levels are available for each sale type, plus an additional 90 levels that can be customized for your different customer types. The Pricing Strategy Assignment may be just the factory pricing (LIST, Trade, Cost), the factory pricing plus or minus a certain percentage (Cost + 25%, List - 10%), or based on a matrix."
